![Alt text](images/screenshot.png?raw=true 'Optional Title')

## Learning objectives

- Understand different ways to create objects in JavaScript.
- Create and access properties and methods of JavaScript objects.

### Instructions

- Deploy your website using GitHub Pages.
- Update the README of your repository to include a link to the online version.

=======

## Built With

- HTML/CSS
- Node.JS

=======

## Getting Started

If you want to visit the deployed app just visit the following link:

- [`https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Awesome_books-m2_w1/`](https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Awesome_books-m2_w1/)

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it

- `git clone https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/Awesome_books-m2_w1`(https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/Awesome_books-m2_w1)

After cloning it you can see the project opening the index.html file with your favorite browser ( Firefox for example )


### Project requirements

- Use JavaScript `classes` instead of `objects` and `arrays`.
  - You can use objects and arrays, but do it *inside* classes.
- Create class `methods` to add and remove books.
- Maintain all of the original functionality of the application.
- Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
-  **You need to use pair-programming for this project. We will check to see if both partners submitted code by looking at the commit history for each project. Therefore you need to use only one repository for your pair-programming group.**

### Prerequisites

- Node.JS
